                  You meet some random person online. You are inspired by his behaviour.
                  
                  You ask him to make you his sister. He happily agrees and says that he also wanted a sister. You chat daily for hours.You begin to trust him. You share your parent’s contact number with him. ( I don’t have a personal phone yet.) He promises you that he will never call you without your permission. You are the happiest. You start loving him even more than your own brother. He shares everything with you; even about his ex- girlfriends.
                  
                  Things continue to go well…….
                  
                  One fine day, he suddenly tells you that he loves you. You are shocked. You are just 15. You don’t know how to react. He asks you to go far away from him. You have a big question-mark on your face. You refuse to leave him. He starts crying in front of you. He tells you that he will undergo depression as he really loves you. You try to console him. Day by day, he becomes worse.
                  
                  Suddenly one day, he asks you to send pics and satisfy his desire. You are broken. he doesn’t understand that you are too small to bear all this. He starts emotionally blackmailing you that he will die if he doesn’t get the pics. You are too scared to think anything. The only option you have is to block him. You block him in all possible ways.
                  
                  You can’t forget him. You can’t sleep peacefully after that for days.
                  
                  But somehow, you have to move on.
                  
                  Gradually, everything starts becoming normal except the permanent wounds he gave to your soul.
                  
                  You won’t ever be able to trust anyone now.
                  
                  You hate yourself the most now for trusting that guy. You curse yourself in every possible way.
                  
                  This incident taught a lot to that 15-year old who is none other than me.
                  
                  This was my darkest secret I haven’t yet told anyone…..not even the person who is the closest to me.</p>
